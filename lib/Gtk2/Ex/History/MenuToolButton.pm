Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton -- toolbar button for history "back" or "forward"

=for test_synopsis my ($my_history, $toolbar)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton;
 my $item = Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton->new
              (history => $my_history,
               way => 'forward');

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton> is a subclass of
C<Gtk2::MenuToolButton>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Container
        Gtk2::Bin
          Gtk2::ToolItem
            Gtk2::ToolButton
              Gtk2::MenuToolButton
                Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a toolbar button which invokes either C<back> or C<forward> on a
C<Gtk2::Ex::History> object.  The arrow part of the button presents a menu
of the history in that direction.

                  | Future Most   |
                  +---------------+

A plain C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Button> can be put in a C<Gtk2::ToolItem> and
used in a toolbar for a similar result.  The difference is whether you
prefer the menu popup with an arrow or with mouse button-3.  The arrow has
the advantage of a visual indication that there's something available.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $item = Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new history button.  Optional key/value pairs can be
given to set initial properties, as per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

The C<history> property should be set to say what to display and act on, and
C<way> for back or forward.

    my $item = Gtk2::Ex::History::MenuToolButton->new
                  (history => $history,
                   way => 'forward');

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<history> (C<Gtk2::Ex::History> object, default C<undef>)

The history object to act on.

=item C<way> (enum C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Way>, default 'back')

The direction to go, either "back" or "forward".

The C<stock-id> property (per C<Gtk2::ToolButton>) is set from this, either
C<gtk-go-back> or C<gtk-go-forward>.

=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::History::Action -- Gtk2::Action to go back or forward in a history

=for test_synopsis my ($my_history, $actiongroup)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::History::Action;
 my $action = Gtk2::Ex::History::Action->new
                 (name    => 'ForwardInHistory',
                  way     => 'forward',
                  history => $my_history);
 $actiongroup->add_action_with_accel ($action, '<Ctrl><Shift>F');

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Action> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::Action>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Action
        Gtk2::Ex::History::Action

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Action> invokes either C<back> or C<forward> on a given
C<Gtk2::Ex::History>.  The "stock" icon and tooltip follow the direction.
The action is insensitive when the history is empty.

When the action is used on a toolbar button a mouse button-3 handler is
added to popup C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Menu>.

If you're not using UIManager and its actions system then see
L<Gtk2::Ex::History::Button> for similar button-3 behaviour.

There's no accelerator keys offered as yet.  "B" and "F" would be natural,
but would depend what other things are in the UIManager and whether letters
should be reserved for text entry etc, or are available as accelerators.
Control-B and Control-F aren't good choices if using a text entry as they're
cursor movement in the Emacs style
F</usr/share/themes/Emacs/gtk-2.0-key/gtkrc>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $action = Gtk2::Ex::History::Action->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new action object.  Optional key/value pairs set initial
properties per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

The C<history> property is what to act on, and C<way> for back or forward.
The usual action C<name> property should be set to identify it in a
UIManager or similar.  The name can be anything desired.  Just "Back" and
"Forward" are good, or something more to distinguish it from other actions.

    my $action = Gtk2::Ex::History::Action->new
                    (name    => 'ForwardHistory',
                     way     => 'forward',
                     history => $history);

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<history> (C<Gtk2::Ex::History> object, default C<undef>)

The history object to act on.

=item C<way> (enum C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Way>, default 'back')

The direction to go, either "back" or "forward".

The "stock" icon is set from this, either C<gtk-go-back> or
C<gtk-go-forward>.

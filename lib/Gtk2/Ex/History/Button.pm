=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::History::Button -- button for history "back" or "forward"

=for test_synopsis my ($my_history)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::History::Button;
 my $button = Gtk2::Ex::History::Button->new
                (history => $my_history,
                 way => 'forward');

=head1 OBJECT HIERARCHY

C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Button> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::Button>.

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Container
        Gtk2::Bin
          Gtk2::Button
            Gtk2::Ex::History::Button

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Button> invokes either C<back> or C<forward> on a
C<Gtk2::Ex::History> object.

    +--------------+
    | ==>  Forward |
    +--------------+

Mouse button-3 opens a C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Menu> to select an entry from a
menu to jump to, to go more than one place back or forward.

A button like this can be used anywhere desired.  If it's put in a
C<Gtk2::ToolItem> it can be used in a C<Gtk2::Toolbar>, though if using
C<Gtk2::UIManager> then see L<Gtk2::Ex::History::Action> instead.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $button = Gtk2::Ex::History::Button->new (key => value, ...) >>

Create and return a new history button.  Optional key/value pairs can be
given to set initial properties, as per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

The C<history> property should be set to say what to display, and C<way> for
back or forward.

    my $button = Gtk2::Ex::History::Button->new
                    (history => $history,
                     way => 'forward');

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<history> (C<Gtk2::Ex::History> object, default C<undef>)

The history object to act on.

=item C<way> (enum C<Gtk2::Ex::History::Way>, default "back")

The direction to go, either "back" or "forward".

The "stock" icon is set from this, either C<gtk-go-back> or
C<gtk-go-forward>.

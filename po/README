This is only a place-holder for possible future translations of the
few messages in the History.

Currently there's nothing translated, and the messages probably aren't
settled enough to want to put work into translation.

"charset=UTF-8" should be used in all the .po files because that's
what History.pm asks for, becoming Perl wide-char strings
internally.  A charset other than utf-8 still works, it just means
gettext must convert at runtime.  The .pot file is all ASCII.

header.pot is the start part of Gtk2-Ex-History.pot, put there
by the generate rules in the Makefile (per inc/MyMakeMakerGettext.pm).
gettext 0.17 doesn't doesn't preserve comments in a .pot header very
well.
